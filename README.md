# dlr-email-templates

Markup reference for DLR email templates.

I am using Nunjucks to build the markup. It helps keeping the common elements in one file.

## Installation

`npm install`

To build the project
`npm run build`

The templates will be located in `_dist/emails/`

## Other bits

To clean the _dist folder
`npm run clean`

To view in the browser
`npm run serve`
